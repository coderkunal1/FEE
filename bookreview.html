       <center><p><b>Summary</b></p></center> 
       <p>"The Picture of Dorian Gray" is a novel written by Oscar Wilde, first published in 1890. Here's a summary of the plot:

        The story begins with the artist Basil Hallward painting a portrait of a young and extraordinarily handsome man named Dorian Gray. Basil becomes infatuated with Dorian's beauty and decides to gift the portrait to him. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a witty and cynical aristocrat, who influences Dorian with his hedonistic worldview, encouraging him to pursue pleasure above all else and to live life to the fullest without moral boundaries.
        
        Dorian, intrigued by Lord Henry's philosophy, expresses a desire for eternal youth and beauty so that the portrait, not himself, will bear the marks of age and sin. His wish is granted, and Dorian remains youthful while the portrait begins to reflect his moral corruption and aging.
        
        As Dorian indulges in a life of debauchery, including relationships with various women and men, the portrait becomes increasingly grotesque, showing signs of Dorian's inner decay and moral degradation. Despite his outward charm and beauty, Dorian's soul grows darker with each immoral act he commits.
        
        Over the years, Dorian's behavior becomes increasingly reckless and cruel. He falls in love with an actress named Sibyl Vane and initially feels genuine love and compassion for her. However, when she disappoints him with a poor performance in a play, he callously rejects her, leading to her suicide. This event marks a turning point for Dorian, as he becomes fully aware of the consequences of his actions but continues down a path of self-destruction.
        
        Throughout the novel, Dorian tries to hide the portrait and the truth about his aging and corrupt soul from the world, even as his reputation deteriorates. Eventually, driven to madness by guilt and horror at the sight of his own portrait, Dorian decides to destroy it, inadvertently ending his own life in the process.
        
        "The Picture of Dorian Gray" explores themes of vanity, narcissism, the pursuit of pleasure, and the consequences of a life without moral restraint. It is a cautionary tale about the dangers of living superficially and the corrupting influence of unchecked desires.</p><hr>
